        <h4>Question 1</h4>
        <h3>
          What are the differences between Local Storage and Session Storage?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> 
          <br>
          <br>Their main difference is that local storage
          data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when
          the user closes its browser window. <br />
          <br />Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has
          three tabs open, each one will have its own page session. 
          <br />

          <br />Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted
          via javascript or manually

        <h4>Question 2</h4>
        <h3>
          What are the differences between Local Storage and Sessio Storage?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong><br />
          <br />

          <strong>Global scope - </strong>Global scope contains all of the
          things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply
          consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if
          statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a
          code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is
          accessible from anywhere in the code.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Local Scope - </strong>Local scope contains things defined
          inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable
          is only accessible where it’s declared.

        <h4>Question 3</h4>
        <h3>
          What is Event Loop in JavaScript? 
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong><br />
          <br />

          The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The asynchronous behavior is not part of the JavaScript language itself, rather it is built on top of the core JavaScript language in the browser (or the programming environment) and accessed through the browser APIs.
          <br>
          <br>

Browser JavaScript execution flow, as well as in Node.js, is based on an event loop. The event loop concept is very simple. There’s an endless loop, where the JavaScript engine waits for tasks, executes them, and then sleeps, waiting for more tasks.
